# ml_in_real_world

so in this repository i will add several python files with ml projects , the objective is to prove the usage of the ml models in the real world

-> the first is about weather

-> the second about the car oil spending 

-> the third about the moon landing possibilities 

-> the fourth about the blue whale survival changes


the ml models are usually simple models examples

like binary classification
